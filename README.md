# SlackOnCall

Integration with Slack to alert the office when someone is on a call. 

Comes with a decorative webpage (to be framed on an old tablet in plain view) that changes based on call status.

Deployed as a heroku app [here!](http://fresh-slack-on-call.herokuapp.com) Currently using the free tier dyno so service might be interupted at any time.
